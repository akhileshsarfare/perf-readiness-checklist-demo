## Quick pitch
A compact, enforceable performance-test readiness checklist used for release-level and per-test sign-offs. Built for engineering teams who want discipline, traceability, and reproducible decision gates.

---

## What this is
This repository provides a **practical Performance Readiness Checklist** intended to be used:
- Once per **performance test cycle / release**
- Once per **individual performance test** (capacity, endurance, spike, etc.)

The checklist is authored in **plain Markdown** so it can live with code, test assets, and release documentation.

---

## Recommended workflow
1. Copy the relevant checklist (`.md`) for your release or test
2. Update it incrementally as gates are validated
3. Store it alongside code or test artifacts
4. Optionally export the markdown to PDF, Word (DOCX), EPUB, or any format of your choice for reviews or sign-off

## How to fill the checklist

### Primary method (preferred)
Use platforms that natively support Markdown task lists such as **GitHub**, **GitLab**, etc.

Example:
```md
- [ ] ENV-01 Environment stable
- [x] TS-03 Assertions validated
```

### Fallback Marking Examples (Tool-Agnostic)
- [X] WL-02 Load model approved
- [ ] TO-04 Tracing validated — PENDING
- PR-07 Error budget verified — DONE
